Array VS Linked-list

1) Computation cost
2) Cost of accessing an element: arr O(1) vs linked-list 0(n):
3) Memory usage
4) Cost of insert or delete an element:
    - beginning: arr O(n) vs linked-list O(1)
    - end: arr 0(1) vs linked-list 0(n) (we have to traverse the whole linked-list to insert)
    - anywhere: arr 0(n) vs linked-list 0(n).
