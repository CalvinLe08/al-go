Binary Tree - at most 2 children nodes

Strict/Proper binary tree
    - it either have 0 or 2 children nodes.

Complete binary tree
    - all levels exept possibly the last are completely filled and all nodes are as left as possible.

Perfect binary tree.
    - Maximun number of nodes in a binary tree with height h
    - 2^(number of levels) - 1

    height of a perfect binary tree:
        - log2(n+1) -1
    
    Balance binary tree
        - difference between height of left and right subtree for every node is not more than k (mostly 1)

    - Preorder
    - Postorder
