Introduction to tree data structure

- In a valid tree, if a tree has n nodes, it will have exactly n-1 number of deges.

Depth and Height of a tree.

Depth of node x can be defined as length of path from root to node x;
=> number of edges from the root to node x;

Height of node x can be defined as longest path from x to leaf node.
Height of the tree can be defined as height of the root node.


Binary tree
- is a tree that a node will have at most as 2 children.

C implementation of a node in a tree;
struct node
{
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

Applications:
    - Storing naturally hierarchial structure of data. (file system)
    - organize data for quick search, insertio, deletion. (BST)
    - Trie -> dictionary
    - Networking routing algorithm
